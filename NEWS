striprtf v0.4.1 (Release date: 2017-05-14)
==============

* Special treatment for tables

  `read_rtf` (and `strip_rtf`) has new options `row_start`, `row_end`, and `cell_end`,
  which specify strings to put at the correponding parts of tables.
  For example, suppose there is a table like below in a RTF document:

  | A  | B | C |
  | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
  | 1.01 | 2.02 | 3. 03|

  In this version, `read_rtf("table.rtf", row_start="**", row_end="**", cell_end="\t")` would return:
  `"**A\tB\tC\t**"          "**1.01\t2.02\t3.03\t**" ""`

  Note that `\t` is put at the end of each cell, not only between cells.

  Supports line breaks within cells.
  No support for merged cells.
  No support for nested tables (i.e. tables within tables).



  For backward compatibility, there is an option `ignore_tables`; Set it `TRUE` to obtain the same behavior as the previous version.
